# Let Astralis Light the Unknown
*A poem from the heart of the Pinnacle*

Beneath the veil of silent night,  
Where fears and shadows steal the light,  
A voice within begins to rise—  
Not born of doubt, but star-lit skies.

When paths ahead are cloaked in gray,  
And comfort calls your soul to stay,  
A flare ignites within your chest,  
A whisper urging not to rest.

**Let Astralis light the unknown,**  
Through every trial you walk alone.  
No map, no guide, no certain way,  
Yet still you rise, and still you stay.

For in the dark, the brave will find  
The spark that fear can never bind.  
With every fall, with every stone,  
The summit calls you to your own.

So walk the road, though cold and wide,  
Let dreams—not dread—become your guide.  
And when the night is yours to own…  
**Let Astralis light the unknown.**
