## ðŸ§­ For Recruiters & Collaborators

Hello,  
I am the creator of **Reltroner Studio** â€” a self-branding and worldbuilding project built with **full dedication, wild imagination, and commitment to real work**.

This website is an expression of who I am, without the need to show my face. For me, **true identity doesn't come from appearance, but from results, consistency, and the courage to take risks.**

Iâ€™m not looking for a place to simply work.  
Iâ€™m building a legacy.  
And if youâ€™re reading this, we might create something impactful together.

I believe in:
- **Meritocracy**: I only want to work with people or teams who value real contribution and growth.
- **Work Ethic**: I learn, practice, and face errors daily to level up.
- **Openness**: Iâ€™m not anti-criticism. Iâ€™m anti-stagnation.

If youâ€™re a recruiter, collaborator, or company owner interested in working with someone who:
- Has deep dedication to their project
- Rejects comfort zones and illusions
- Prefers real output over empty words

...feel free to reach out through the contacts below:

I may not appear on camera,  
But Iâ€™m **fully present in every line of code and trace of my work.**
