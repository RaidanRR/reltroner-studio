# ⚖️ Legal Disclaimer – Reltroner Studio

Reltroner Studio is an original creation by **Raidan Malik Sandra**, developed as part of a self-branding and worldbuilding initiative, focused on digital philosophy, meritocracy, and personal growth through adversity.

This website, including its terms, stories, systems, and world concepts — such as **Astralis Pinnacle**, **Nytherion Abyss**, **Energy Red Pill**, **Energy Blue Pill**, and the nations like **Reltronland** — are entirely products of original imagination and not derived from any specific franchise or universe.

## 🚨 Use of “Red Pill” and “Blue Pill”

We acknowledge that the terms *“Red Pill”* and *“Blue Pill”* were popularized by the film *The Matrix (1999)*, owned by Warner Bros. However:

- Reltroner Studio **does not copy, reuse, or adapt** any character, script, dialogue, or plot from *The Matrix*.
- The terms *red pill* and *blue pill* used here are **philosophical metaphors**, representing **spiritual clarity** and **psychological illusion** in a completely different context.
- All implementations within this site are **original in their narrative meaning and system structure**.

## 🧠 Original Concepts

All core systems — including:
- 🔺 *Astralis Pinnacle*
- 🕳️ *Nytherion Abyss*
- ⚡ *Energy Red Pill / Blue Pill*
- 🏙️ *Reltronland, Depcutland, etc.*

...are created from scratch and documented thoroughly as part of the worldbuilding legacy of Raidan Malik Sandra.
