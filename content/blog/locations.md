# Locations & Geography

Geography shapes culture, war, travel, trade — even belief systems. In world-building, location isn’t just a backdrop; it’s a character.

- **Rivers & Lakes** – Sources of life, trade routes, and settlements.
- **Deserts** – Harsh environments that shape resilience and isolation.
- **Forests & Jungles** – Wild, mystical, or forbidden regions.
- **Oceans & Islands** – Hubs for naval powers, mysteries, and exploration.
